Dinner that night was very nice. We caught up with Jane again after being refreshed from the massage
and we asked our hostel owner where was a good Malay place to eat. Our hostel owner recommended us some
random place advertising fish outside the front, and we gladly agreed. The interesting thing about Langkawi
was that at one point it was occupied by the Siam Kingdom, or, Thai folk. So, sometimes the curries
that you see in Malaysia will be infused with a Thai flavor. In fact, the land itself is closer I believe to the
Thai border than it is to Malaysia, so much to the point that people in the north of the island will speak Thai
and understand it fluently. As such, you get a lot of Thai-influenced things such as people who watch boxing, 
people who speak Thai, a Bahasa Melayu with Thai words, and, most importantly, Thai-inspired food. I'm talking
about that sourish spicy flavor that you get -- you know, your Tom Yums and that -- all that good bizniz. Even better,
since Malay food tends to be sweet, when you mix the sweet, sour, and spicy together, you get a very unique
flavor in the region. So, that night we ordered some Padprik Ayam, which was a Langkawi curry with chicken.
One of the best I've ever had. Thorin and I also decided to go all out and try a fish cooked in a sweet and sour sauce,
also super delicious. I of course took a picture before we killed that fish for a second time, in our mouths.
